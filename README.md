# EcoSort Vision ♻️

EcoSort Vision is an AI-assisted waste segregation web application that helps users identify waste as **Organic Waste** or **Recyclable Waste** using image upload or camera capture.

The system is designed to support smarter waste management by combining image classification, waste level estimation, and harmful waste alerts in a clean and user-friendly interface

Developed during an industry-oriented internship focused on AI for sustainability solutions.

🧠 How It Works
1.User uploads or captures a waste image.
2.Image is preprocessed for classification.
3.AI model predicts waste type.
4.Additional modules analyze:
  >waste level
  >Harmful waste objects
  >Multi-item scan
5.Results displayed instantly.

📌 Notes
 >Includes fallback compatibility mode if legacy model loading fails.
 >Lightweight sample dataset included.
 >Designed as a student innovation project for sustainable waste management.

🔮 Future Enhancements
 >Add more waste categories (plastic, metal, glass, e-waste)
 >Real-time webcam detection
 >Mobile application
 >Cloud deployment
 >Smart dustbin integration using IoT
 >User dashboard with analytics

💼 Use Case

This project can be useful for:

  >Smart cities
  >Educational institutions
  >Waste collection agencies
  >Recycling centers
  >Public awareness campaigns

## 💼 Internship Project

EcoSort Vision was developed as part of an internship program conducted through Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE and Shell.

The project focused on applying AI and web technologies to solve real-world sustainability challenges through smart waste segregation.
